# Plant Seedling Classification

This project aims to classify different types of plant seedlings using deep learning techniques. The goal is to build a convolutional neural network (CNN) model that can accurately classify the seedlings based on input images.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of images of various plant seedlings belonging to 12 different classes. The dataset is divided into a training set and a validation set.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
2. Install the required dependencies:
   
4. Download the dataset and place it in the appropriate directory.

5. Run the Jupyter Notebook:

6. Open the `High_Code_Plant_Seedling_Classification_1.ipynb` notebook and follow the instructions to train and evaluate the model.

## Model Architecture

The model architecture used for this project is a CNN with multiple convolutional layers, max pooling layers, batch normalization layers, and fully connected layers. The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss.
